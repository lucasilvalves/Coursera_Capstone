# Coursera_Capstone
This is a repository on which I'm going to develop my capstone project with Python and its Data Science libraries, in order to achieve the Applied Data Science certificate. Feel free to see my work! :)

The notebook used to develop the solution is [here on Gist](https://gist.github.com/lucasilvalves/407d24ce5bd5b274efdb6b048efe06f4).
