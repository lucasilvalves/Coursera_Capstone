# Coursera_Capstone
This is a repository on which I'm going to develop my capstone project with Python and its Data Science libraries, in order to achieve the Applied Data Science certificate. Feel free to see my work! :)

The notebook used to launch the challenge is [here on Gist](https://gist.github.com/lucasilvalves/407d24ce5bd5b274efdb6b048efe06f4).

## Activity #1 - Clustering the Neighborhoods of Toronto

This first activity is more detailed on my notebook [published on Gist](https://gist.github.com/lucasilvalves/35d8defb98f5d8a5bec640190c41998f)
